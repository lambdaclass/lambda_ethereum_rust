## What

The prover consists of two main components: handling incoming proving data from the `L2 proposer`, specifically the `prover_server` component, and the `zkVM`. The `prover_client` is responsible for this first part, while the `zkVM` serves as a RISC-V emulator executing code specified in `crates/l2/prover/zkvm/interface/guest/src`. 
Before the `zkVM` code (or guest), there is a directory called `interface`, which indicates that we access the `zkVM` through the "interface" crate.

In summary, the `prover_client` manages the inputs from the `prover_server` and then "calls" the `zkVM` to perform the proving process and generate the `groth16` ZK proof.

## Workflow

The `Prover Server` monitors requests for new jobs from the `Prover Client`, which are sent when the prover is available. Upon receiving a new job, the Prover generates the proof, after which the `Prover Client` sends the proof back to the `Prover Server`.

    zkVM-->>-ProverClient: Creates zkProof
    ProverClient->>+ProverServer: ProofData::Submit(block_number, zkProof)
    ProverServer-->>-ProverClient: ProofData::SubmitAck(block_number)
```

## How

### Dev Mode

**Dependencies:**
- [RISC0](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/install)

To run the blockchain (`proposer`) and prover in conjunction in a development environment, set the following environment variable: `RISC0_DEV_MODE=1` [(docs)](https://dev.risczero.com/api/generating-proofs/dev-mode). If you are in the `crates/l2` directory, you will need to set the environment variable for `dev_mode`. The `.env.example` file should suffice.

To start the `prover_client`, use the following command:

```sh
make init-l2-prover
```

The `build_zkvm` flag is used, if you don't have the risc0's "sdk", you can build the prover without the feature to check if all the surrounding components of the `zkvm` can be compiled.

#### Quick Test

To test the `zkvm` execution quickly, the following test can be run:

```sh
cd crates/l2/prover
make perf_test_proving
```

### GPU mode

**Dependencies (based on the Docker CUDA image):**

>[!NOTE]
> If you don't want to run it inside a Docker container based on the NVIDIA CUDA image, [the following steps from RISC0](https://dev.risczero.com/api/generating-proofs/local-proving) may be helpful.

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [RISC0](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/install)

Next, install the following packages:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev pkg-config libclang-dev clang
```

To start the `prover_client`, use the following command:

```sh
make init-l2-prover-gpu
```

#### Proving Process Test

To test the `zkvm` proving process using a `gpu` quickly, the following test can be run:

```sh
cd crates/l2/prover
make perf_gpu
```

## Configuration

The following environment variables are available to configure the prover:

- `PROVER_SERVER_LISTEN_IP`: IP used to start the Server.
- `PROVER_SERVER_LISTEN_PORT`: Port used to start the Server.
- `PROVER_CLIENT_PROVER_SERVER_ENDPOINT`: Prover Server's Endpoint used to connect the Client to the Server.
